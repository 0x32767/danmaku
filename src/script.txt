Sceen 1
-------

This sceen is set in a large room to fit a massive tree. The tree takes up most of the room
as well as some empty boxes. There is also a comically large ladder that streches from the
floor to 2/3rds of the way up the tree. One of the Ever Green is neer the top of the ladder
holding a ball ball. Snow Flake is at the bottom of the ladder neer the crates. With their
arms by their sides. Both elfs are in a traditionall green zelda-like dress. However, Snow
Flake has their hat by their left arm as if they they have had enough (of decorating the,
tree), while Ever Green has their hat on. This sceen will have verry contrasting colours
reminicent of a 1990s video game, like pacman. The colors must be fairly basic. The costume
needs to be a verry bright shade of green too.


Snow Flake : How much longer will it take to finish the tree?
Ever Green : At least another few hours.
Snow Flake : Hours!? The party is only in two!
Ever Green : I know. I know. Beats making presents.
Snow Flake : I am not so sure now.
Ever Green : Stop moaning, you are putting me of now. Anyway, give me a another crate.
Snow Flake : Another?
Ever Green : Yes. What, run out?
Snow Flake : I think so.
Ever Green : Okay, but are we actually out?
Snow Flake : Yes. I don't see any arround me.
Ever Green : Sounds like a you problem.
Snow Flake : Keep decorating the tree, I'l look.
